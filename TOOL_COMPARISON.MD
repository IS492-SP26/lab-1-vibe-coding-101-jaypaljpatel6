I used three tools - Cursor, Gemini, and Copilot - to build the Ping-Pong game, and overall the games looked very similar, with all three following a simple black-and-white theme. In terms of code readability, Cursor was the best, followed by Gemini and then Copilot. It is important to note that Cursor was also quite user friendly when installing required libraries for the game. Copilot had the cleanest UI, with the score placed toward the center top, while Cursor and Gemini placed the score at the top in a way that sometimes blocked the view of the ball. Even though all three tools were given the same prompt, Gemini produced a single-player game, whereas Cursor and Copilot created multiplayer games. In terms of speed, Cursor was the fastest at producing a working output, followed by Gemini and then Copilot. Cursor and Copilot were also the easiest tool to work with when debugging, gemini being in terminal was difficult as it needed constant switching betweeen screens. Overall, Cursor felt the most flexible and easiest to customize, while Gemini and Copilot required more effort to make changes or improvements.
